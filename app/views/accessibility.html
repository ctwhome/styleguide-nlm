                A product is accessible when all people -- regardless of ability -- can navigate it, understand it, and use it to achieve their goals. A truly successful product is accessible to the widest possible audience.

                These general guidelines are a good starting point for designers who want to learn about accessibility. Designing fully accessible products is a complex topic that requires in-depth study. For more info, visit the Google accessibility site.

                To ensure that your product is usable for users with disabilities, consider how users will interact with your product using assistive technologies. Imagine using your product in the following ways:
            <ul>
                <li>Without sound</li>
                <li>Without color</li>
                <li>With the high contrast mode enabled</li>
                <li>With the screen magnified</li>
                <li>With a screen reader (no visible screen)</li>
                <li>With voice control only</li>
                <li>With a combination of the above</li>
            </ul>
